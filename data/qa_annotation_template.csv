"Transformers works with PyTorch, TensorFlow 2.0, and Flax. It has been tested on Python 3.9+, PyTorch 2.1+, TensorFlow 2.6+, and Flax 0.4.1+.","Which machine learning frameworks are supported by Transformers?","PyTorch, TensorFlow 2.0, and Flax"
"A virtual environment helps manage different projects and avoids compatibility issues between dependencies. Take a look at the Install packages in a virtual environment using pip and venv guide if you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments.","Why should I use a virtual environment when working with Transformers?","A virtual environment helps manage different projects and avoids compatibility issues between dependencies"
"To install Transformers with pip, run: pip install transformers. This will install the package in your Python environment.","How do I install Transformers using pip?","pip install transformers"
"The Trainer class provides an API for feature-complete training in PyTorch, and it supports distributed training on multiple GPUs/TPUs, mixed precision for NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and torch.amp for PyTorch. Trainer goes hand-in-hand with the TrainingArguments class, which offers a wide range of options to customize how a model is trained.","What is the purpose of the Trainer class in Transformers?","The Trainer class provides an API for feature-complete training in PyTorch, and it supports distributed training on multiple GPUs/TPUs, mixed precision for NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and torch.amp for PyTorch"
"The pipelines are a great and easy way to use models for inference. These pipelines are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, Masked Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction and Question Answering.","What is the purpose of pipelines in Transformers?","These pipelines are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, Masked Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction and Question Answering."
